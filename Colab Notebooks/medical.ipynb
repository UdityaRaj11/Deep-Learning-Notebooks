For example, \\nthe finding of scaling papules, which are present in psoriasis or atopic \\ndermatitis, places the patient in a different diagnostic category than would hemorrhagic papules, which may indicate vasculitis or sepsis (Figs. 52-4 and 52-5, respectively) . It is also important to differentiate \\nprimary from secondary skin lesions. If the examiner focuses on linear erosions overlying an area of erythema and scaling, he or she may incorrectly assume that the erosion is the primary lesion and that the redness and scale are secondary, whereas the correct interpretation would be that the patient has a pruritic eczematous dermatitis with erosions caused by scratching.APPROACH TO THE PATIENT\\nSkin Disorder\\nIn examining the skin it is usually advisable to assess the patient before taking an extensive history. This approach ensures that the entire cutaneous surface will be evaluated, and objective findings can be integrated with relevant historical data. Four basic features of a skin lesion must be noted and considered during a physical examination: the distribution of the eruption, the types of primary and \\nsecondary lesions, the shape of individual lesions, and the arrange-\\nment of the lesions. An ideal skin examination includes evaluation \\nHarrisons_20e_Part2_p0065-p0418.indd   326 6/1/18   3:16 PM\\n\\nCHAPTER 52 Approach to the Patient with a Skin Disorder 327\\nFIGURE 52-4  Necrotizing vasculitis. Palpable purpuric papules on the lower \\nlegs are seen in this patient with cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis. (Courtesy of \\nRobert Swerlick, MD; with permission.)\\nFIGURE 52-5  Meningococcemia. An example of fulminant meningococcemia \\nwith extensive angular purpuric patches. (Courtesy of Stephen E. Gellis, MD; with \\npermission.)of the skin, hair, and nails as well as the mucous membranes of \\nthe mouth, eyes, nose, nasopharynx, and anogenital region. In the initial examination, it is important that the patient be disrobed as completely as possible to minimize chances of missing important individual skin lesions and permit accurate assessment of the dis -\\ntribution of the eruption. The patient should first be viewed from a distance of about 1.5–2 m (4–6 ft) so that the general character of the skin and the distribution of lesions can be evaluated. Indeed, the dis -\\ntribution of lesions often correlates highly with diagnosis (Fig. 52-6). \\nFor example, a hospitalized patient with a generalized erythematous exanthem is more likely to have a drug eruption than is a patient with a similar rash limited to the sun-exposed portions of the face. Once the distribution of the lesions has been established, the nature of the primary lesion must be determined. Thus, when lesions are distributed on elbows, knees, and scalp, the most likely possibility based solely on distribution is psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis (Figs. 52-7 and 52-8, respectively). The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this man -\\nner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate palpable purpura characteristic of necrotizing vasculitis (Fig. 52-4).\\nThe shape of lesions is also an important feature. Flat, round, \\nerythematous papules and plaques are common in many cutane -\\nous diseases. However, target-shaped lesions that consist in part of erythematous plaques are specific for erythema multiforme  \\n(Fig. 52-9). Likewise, the arrangement of individual lesions is impor -\\ntant. Erythematous papules and vesicles can occur in many condi -\\ntions, but their arrangement in a specific linear array suggests an external etiology such as allergic contact dermatitis (Fig. 52-10) or primary irritant dermatitis. In contrast, lesions with a generalized arrangement are common and suggest a systemic etiology.\\nAs in other branches of medicine, a complete history should be \\nobtained to emphasize the following features:\\n1. Evolution of lesions\\na. Site of onset\\nb. Manner in which the eruption progr essed or spread\\nc. Duration\\nd. Periods of resolution or improvement in chr onic eruptions\\n2. Symptoms associated with the eruption\\na. Itching, burning, pain, numbness\\nb. What, if anything, has relieved symptoms\\nc. Time of day when symptoms are most severe\\n3.  Current or recent medications (prescribed as well as \\nover-the-counter)\\n4. Associated systemic symptoms (e.g., malaise, fever, arthralgias)\\n5. Ongoing or previous illnesses\\n6.

Social, sexual, or travel history\\n■■DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES\\nMany skin diseases can be diagnosed on the basis of gross clinical appearance, but sometimes relatively simple diagnostic procedures can yield valuable information. In most instances, they can be performed at the bedside with a minimum of equipment.\\nSkin Biopsy  A skin biopsy is a straightforward minor surgical pro -\\ncedure; however, it is important to biopsy a lesion that is most likely to yield diagnostic findings. This decision may require expertise in skin diseases and knowledge of superficial anatomic structures in selected areas of the body. In this procedure, a small area of skin is anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with or without epinephrine. The skin lesion in ques -\\ntion can be excised or saucerized with a scalpel or removed by punch biopsy. In the latter technique, a punch is pressed against the surface of the skin and rotated with downward pressure until it penetrates to the subcutaneous tissue. The circular biopsy is then lifted with forceps, and the bottom is cut with iris scissors. Biopsy sites may or may not need suture closure, depending on size and location.\\nKOH Preparation  A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is \\nperformed on scaling skin lesions where a fungal infection is suspected. The edge of such a lesion is scraped gently with a no. 15 scalpel blade. The removed scale is collected on a glass microscope slide and then treated with 1 or 2 drops of a solution of 10–20% KOH. KOH dissolves keratin and allows easier visualization of fungal elements. Brief heating of the slide accelerates dissolution of keratin. When the preparation is viewed under the microscope, the refractile hyphae are seen more easily when the light intensity is reduced and the condenser is low -\\nered.

Episodes of pain \\nand remission without an identifiable cause and a lack of relief with local \\nanesthesia are important clues. Trigeminal neuralgia ( tic douloureux) can \\ninvolve the entire branch or part of the mandibular or maxillary branch of the fifth cranial nerve and can produce pain in one or a few teeth. Pain may occur spontaneously or may be triggered by touching the lip or gingiva, brushing the teeth, or chewing. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia  \\nproduces similar acute neuropathic symptoms in the distribution of the ninth cranial nerve. Swallowing, sneezing, coughing, or pressure on the tragus of the ear triggers pain that is felt in the base of the tongue, phar -\\nynx, and soft palate and may be referred to the temporomandibular joint. Neuritis involving the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigem -\\ninal nerve (e.g., maxillary sinusitis, neuroma, and leukemic infiltrate) is distinguished from ordinary toothache by the neuropathic quality of the pain. Occasionally, phantom pain follows tooth extraction. Pain and hype -\\nralgesia behind the ear and on the side of the face in the day or so before facial weakness develops often constitute the earliest symptom of Bell’s \\npalsy. Likewise, similar symptoms may precede visible lesions of herpes zoster infecting the seventh nerve (Ramsey-Hunt syndrome) or trigemi-nal nerve. Postherpetic neuralgia may follow either condition. Coronary \\nischemia may produce pain exclusively in the face and jaw; as in typical angina pectoris, this pain is usually reproducible with increased myo -\\ncardial demand. Aching in several upper molar or premolar teeth that is unrelieved by anesthetizing the teeth may point to maxillary sinusitis.\\nGiant cell arteritis is notorious for producing headache, but it may \\nalso produce facial pain or sore throat without headache. Jaw and tongue claudication with chewing or talking is relatively common. Tongue infarction is rare. Patients with subacute thyroiditis often experience pain referred to the face or jaw before the tenderness of the thyroid gland and transient hyperthyroidism are appreciated.\\n“Burning mouth syndrome” ( glossodynia) occurs in the absence of an \\nidentifiable cause (e.g., vitamin B\\n12 deficiency, iron deficiency, diabetes TABLE 32-1  Vesicular, Bullous , or Ulcerative Lesions of the Oral Mucosa\\nCONDITION USUAL LOCATION CLINICAL FEATURES COURSE\\nBacterial or Fungal Diseases (Continued)\\nHistoplasmosis Any area of the mouth, \\nparticularly tongue, gingiva, or palateNodular, verrucous, or granulomatous lesions;

When psoriatic lesions are accom -\\npanied by arthritis, the possibility of psoriatic arthritis or reactive \\narthritis should be considered. A history of oral ulcers, conjunctivitis, uveitis, and/or urethritis points to the latter diagnosis. Lithium, beta blockers, HIV or streptococcal infections, and a rapid taper of systemic glucocorticoids are known to exacerbate psoriasis; despite being used to treat psoriasis, TNF- α inhibitors can also induce psoriatic lesions. \\nComorbidities in patients with psoriasis include cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.\\nWhenever the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea or lichen planus is made, \\nit is important to review the patient’s medications because the eruption may resolve by simply discontinuing the offending agent. Pityriasis rosea–like drug eruptions are seen most commonly with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and metronidazole, whereas the drugs that can produce a lichenoid eruption include thiazides, antimalarials, quinidine, beta blockers, TNF- α inhibitors, \\nanti-PD-1/PD-L1 Ab, and ACE inhibitors. In some populations, there is a higher prevalence of hepatitis C viral infection in patients with oral lichen planus. Lichen planus–like lesions are also observed in chronic graft-versus-host disease.\\nIn its early stages, the mycosis fungoides (MF) form of cutaneous  \\nT cell lymphoma (CTCL) may be confused with eczema or psoriasis, but it often fails to respond to appropriate therapy for those inflammatory diseases. MF can develop within lesions of large-plaque parapsoriasis and is suggested by an increase in the thickness of the lesions. The diagnosis of MF is established by skin biopsy in which collections of atypical T lymphocytes are found in the epidermis and dermis. As the disease progresses, cutaneous tumors and lymph node involvement may appear.\\nIn secondary syphilis, there are scattered red-brown papules with \\nthin scale. The eruption often involves the palms and soles and can resemble pityriasis rosea. Associated findings are helpful in making the diagnosis and include annular plaques on the face, nonscarring alopecia, condyloma lata (broad-based and moist), and mucous patches as well as lymphadenopathy, malaise, fever, headache, and myalgias. The interval between the primary chancre and the secondary stage is usually 4–8 weeks, and spontaneous resolution without appropriate therapy occurs.\\nERYTHRODERMA\\n(Table 54-2) Erythroderma is the term used when the majority of the \\nskin surface is erythematous (red in color). There may be associated scale, erosions, or pustules as well as shedding of the hair and nails. Potential systemic manifestations include fever, chills, hypothermia, reactive lymphadenopathy, peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, and high-output cardiac failure. The major etiologies of erythroderma are (1) cutaneous diseases such as psoriasis and dermatitis (Table 54-3); \\n(2) drugs; (3) systemic diseases, most commonly CTCL; and (4) idio -\\npathic. In the first three groups, the location and description of the initial lesions, prior to the development of the erythroderma, aid in the diagnosis. For example, a history of red scaly plaques on the elbows and knees would point to psoriasis. It is also important to examine the skin carefully for a migration of the erythema and associated secondary \\nHarrisons_20e_Part2_p0065-p0418.indd   339 6/1/18   3:17 PM\\n\\nPART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases340\\nTABLE 54-3  Erythroderma (Pr imary Cutaneous Disorders)\\nINITIAL LESIONSLOCATION OF INITIAL \\nLESIONS OTHER FINDINGS DIAGNOSTIC AIDS TREATMENT\\nPsoriasisaPink-red, silvery scale, sharply demarcatedElbows, knees, scalp, presacral area, intergluteal foldNail dystrophy, arthritis, pustules, SAPHO syndrome\\nbSkin biopsy Topical glucocorticoids, vitamin D; UV-B (narrowband) > PUVA; oral retinoid; MTX, cyclosporine, anti-TNF agents, apremilast, anti-IL-12/23 Ab, anti-IL-17A or -IL-17 receptor Ab\\nDermatitisa\\nAtopic Acute:\\nErythema, fine scale, \\ncrust, indistinct borders, excoriations\\nChronic:Lichenification (increased \\nskin markings), excoriationsAntecubital and popliteal fossae, neck, hands, eyelidsPruritus\\nPersonal and/or family history of \\natopy, including asthma, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis\\nExclude secondary infection with \\nStaphylococcus aureus or HSV\\nExclude superimposed irritant or \\nallergic contact dermatitisSkin biopsy Topical glucocorticoids, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, tar, and antipruritics; oral antihistamines; open wet dressings; UV-B ± UV-A > PUVA; oral/IM glucocorticoids (short-term); MTX; mycophenolate mofetil; azathioprine; cyclosporine; anti-IL-4/13 Ab\\nTopical or oral antibiotics\\nContact Local:Erythema, crusting, \\nvesicles, and bullae \\nSystemic:\\nErythema, fine scale, \\ncrustDepends on offending agent  \\nGeneralized vs major \\nintertriginous zones (especially groin)Irritant—onset often within hours\\nAllergic—delayed-type \\nhypersensitivity; lag time of 48 h with re-challenge\\nPatient has history of allergic \\ncontact dermatitis to topical agent and then receives systemic medication that is structurally related, e.g., formaldehyde (skin), aspartame (oral)Patch testing; repeat open application test \\nPatch testingRemove irritant or allergen; \\ntopical glucocorticoids; oral antihistamines; oral/IM glucocorticoids (short-term)\\nSame as local\\nSeborrheic (rare in \\nadults)Pink-red to pink-orange, greasy scaleScalp, nasolabial folds, eyebrows, intertriginous zonesFlares with stress, HIV infection\\nAssociated with Parkinson’s \\ndiseaseSkin biopsy Topical glucocorticoids and imidazoles\\nStasis (with autosensitization)Erythema, crusting, excoriationsLower extremities Pruritus, lower extremity edema, varicosities, hemosiderin deposits, lipodermatosclerosis\\nHistory of venous ulcers, \\nthrombophlebitis, and/or cellulitis\\nExclude cellulitisExclude superimposed contact \\ndermatitis, e.g., topical neomycinSkin biopsy Topical glucocorticoids; open wet dressings; leg elevation; pressure stockings; pressure wraps if associated ulcers\\nPityriasis rubra pilarisOrange-red (salmon-colored), perifollicular papulesGeneralized, but \\ncharacteristic “skip” areas of normal skinWax-like palmoplantar keratoderma\\nExclude cutaneous T cell \\nlymphomaSkin biopsy Isotretinoin or acitretin; MTX; perhaps anti-IL-12/23 Ab, anti-TNF agents, anti-IL-17 Ab\\naDiscussed in detail in Chap. 53 . bSAPHO syndrome occurs more commonly in patients with palmoplantar pustulosis than in those with erythrodermic psoriasis.\\nAbbreviations: Ab, antibody; HSV , herpes simplex virus; IL, interleukin; IM, intramuscular; MTX, methotrexate; PUVA, psoralens + ultraviolet A irradiation; SAPHO, \\nsynovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (a subtype is chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis); TNF, tumor necrosis factor; UV-A, ultraviolet A irradiation; \\nUV-B, ultraviolet B irradiation.\\nchanges such as pustules or erosions.

A number of drugs can produce an erythroderma, including penicillins, sulfonamides, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and allopurinol. Fever and peripheral eosinophilia often accompany the eruption, and there may also be facial swelling, hepatitis, myocar -\\nditis, thyroiditis, and allergic interstitial nephritis; this constellation is frequently referred to as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \\nsymptoms (DRESS) or drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction  (DIHS). In \\naddition, these reactions, especially to aromatic anticonvulsants, can lead to a pseudolymphoma syndrome (with adenopathy and circu -\\nlating atypical lymphocytes), while reactions to allopurinol may be accompanied by gastrointestinal bleeding.\\nThe most common malignancy that is associated with erythroderma \\nis CTCL; in some series, up to 25% of the cases of erythroderma were due to CTCL. The patient may progress from isolated plaques and tumors, but more commonly, the erythroderma is present throughout the course of the disease (Sézary syndrome). In Sézary syndrome, there are circulating clonal atypical T lymphocytes, pruritus, and lymph -\\nadenopathy. In cases of erythroderma where there is no apparent cause (idiopathic), longitudinal evaluation is mandatory to monitor for the possible development of CTCL. There have been isolated case reports of erythroderma secondary to some solid tumors—lung, liver, prostate, thyroid, and colon—but it is primarily during a late stage of the disease.\\nALOPECIA\\n(Table 54-4) The two major forms of alopecia are scarring and non -\\nscarring. Scarring alopecia is associated with fibrosis, inflammation, \\nand loss of hair follicles. A smooth scalp with a decreased number of follicular openings is usually observed clinically, but in some patients, the changes are seen only in biopsy specimens from affected areas.  \\nHarrisons_20e_Part2_p0065-p0418.indd   340 6/1/18   3:17 PM'),\n"," Document(page_content='ative process. The latter is accompanied by greater visual loss, pain,  \\nphotophobia, redness, and discharge. Slit-lamp examination shows  \\ndisruption of the corneal epithelium, a cloudy infiltrate or abscess in the stroma, and an inflammatory cellular reaction in the anterior cham -\\nber. In severe cases, pus settles at the bottom of the anterior chamber, giving rise to a hypopyon. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated after corneal scrapings are obtained for Gram’s stain, Giemsa stain, and cultures. Fortified topical antibiotics are most effective, supplemented with subconjunctival antibiotics as required. A fungal etiology should always be considered in a patient with keratitis. Fungal infection is common in warm humid climates, especially after penetration of the cornea by plant or vegetable material. Acanthamoeba keratitis is associated with improper disinfection of contact lenses.\\nHerpes Simplex  The herpesviruses are a major cause of blindness \\nfrom keratitis. Most adults in the United States have serum antibodies to herpes simplex, indicating prior viral infection (Chap. 187). Primary \\nocular infection generally is caused by herpes simplex type 1 rather than type 2. It manifests as a unilateral follicular blepharoconjunctivitis that is easily confused with adenoviral conjunctivitis, unless telltale vesicles are present on the eyelids or conjunctiva. A dendritic pattern of corneal epithelial ulceration revealed by fluorescein staining is pathog -\\nnomonic for herpes infection but is seen in only a minority of primary infections. Recurrent ocular infection arises from reactivation of the latent herpesvirus. Viral eruption in the corneal epithelium may result in the characteristic herpes dendrite. Involvement of the corneal stroma produces edema, vascularization, and iridocyclitis. Herpes keratitis is treated with cycloplegia, and either a topical antiviral (trifluridine, ganciclovir) or an oral antiviral (acyclovir, ganciclovir) agent. Topical glucocorticoids are effective in mitigating corneal scarring but are generally reserved for cases involving stromal damage, because of the danger of corneal melting and perforation. Topical glucocorticoids also carry the risk of prolonging infection and inducing glaucoma.\\nHerpes Zoster  Herpes zoster from reactivation of latent varicella \\n(chickenpox) virus causes a dermatomal pattern of painful vesicu -\\nlar dermatitis (Chap. 188). Ocular symptoms can occur after zoster eruption in any branch of the trigeminal nerve but are particularly common when vesicles form on the nose, reflecting nasociliary (V1) nerve involvement (Hutchinson’s sign). Herpes zoster ophthalmicus produces corneal dendrites, which can be difficult to distinguish from those seen in herpes simplex. Stromal keratitis, anterior uveitis, raised intraocular pressure, ocular motor nerve palsies, acute retinal necrosis, and postherpetic scarring and neuralgia are other common seque -\\nlae. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is treated with antiviral agents and cycloplegics. In severe cases, glucocorticoids may be added to prevent permanent visual loss from corneal scarring.\\nEpiscleritis  This is an inflammation of the episclera, a thin layer \\nof connective tissue between the conjunctiva and the sclera. Episc-leritis resembles conjunctivitis, but it is a more localized process and discharge is absent. Most cases of episcleritis are idiopathic, but some occur in the setting of an autoimmune disease. Scleritis refers to a \\ndeeper, more severe inflammatory process that frequently is associated with a connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangi -\\n\\nitis, or relapsing polychondritis. The inflammation and thickening of the sclera can be diffuse or nodular. In anterior forms of scleritis, the globe assumes a violet hue and the patient complains of severe ocular tenderness and pain. With posterior scleritis, the pain and redness may be less marked, but there is often proptosis, choroidal effusion, reduced motility, and visual loss. Episcleritis and scleritis should be treated with NSAIDs. If these agents fail, topical or even systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be necessary, especially if an underlying autoimmune process is active.\\nUveitis  Involving the anterior structures of the eye, uveitis also is \\ncalled iritis or iridocyclitis. The diagnosis requires slit-lamp examination \\nto identify inflammatory cells floating in the aqueous humor or depos -\\nited on the corneal endothelium (keratic precipitates). Anterior uveitis develops in sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, reactive arthritis, and Behçet’s disease. It also is associated with herpes infections, syphilis, Lyme disease, onchocerciasis, tuberculosis, and leprosy. Although ante -\\nrior uveitis can occur in conjunction with many diseases, no cause is found to explain the majority of cases. For this reason, laboratory eval -\\nuation usually is reserved for patients with recurrent or severe anterior uveitis. Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation and scarring by judicious use of topical glucocorticoids. Dilatation of the pupil reduces pain and prevents the formation of synechiae.\\nHarrisons_20e_Part2_p0065-p0418.indd   182 6/1/18   3:15 PM\\n\\nCHAPTER 28 Disorders of the Eye183\\nFIGURE 28-4  Roth’s spot, cotton-wool spot, and retinal hemorrhages  in a \\n48-year-old liver transplant patient with candidemia from immunosuppression.Posterior Uveitis  This is diagnosed by observing inflammation of \\nthe vitreous, retina, or choroid on fundus examination. It is more likely \\nthan anterior uveitis to be associated with an identifiable systemic disease. Some patients have panuveitis, or inflammation of both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Posterior uveitis is a manifestation of auto -\\nimmune diseases such as sarcoidosis, Behçet’s disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-  \\nHarada syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. It also accompanies diseases such as toxoplasmosis, onchocerciasis, cysticercosis, coccid -\\nioidomycosis, toxocariasis, and histoplasmosis; infections caused by organisms such as Candida, Pneumocystis carinii, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, \\nherpes, and cytomegalovirus (see Fig. 190-1) ; and other diseases, such \\nas syphilis, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease, Whipple’s disease, and brucellosis. In multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory changes can develop in the extreme periphery of the retina (pars plani -\\ntis or intermediate uveitis). Glucocorticoids have been the mainstay of treatment for noninfectious uveitis. Monoclonal antibodies which target proinflammatory cytokines, such as the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor adalimumab, are effective at preventing vision loss in chronic uveitis.\\nAcute Angle-Closure Glaucoma  This is an unusual but fre -\\nquently misdiagnosed cause of a red, painful eye. Asian populations have a particularly high risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Susceptible eyes have a shallow anterior chamber because the eye has either a short axial length (hyperopia) or a lens enlarged by the gradual development of cataract. When the pupil becomes mid-dilated, the peripheral iris blocks aqueous outflow via the anterior chamber angle and the intraoc-ular pressure rises abruptly, producing pain, injection, corneal edema, obscurations, and blurred vision. In some patients, ocular symptoms are overshadowed by nausea, vomiting, or headache, prompting a fruitless workup for abdominal or neurologic disease. The diagnosis is made by measuring the intraocular pressure during an acute attack or by performing gonioscopy, a procedure that allows one to observe a narrow chamber angle with a mirrored contact lens. Acute angle closure is treated with acetazolamide (PO or IV), topical beta blockers, prostaglandin analogues, α\\n2-adrenergic agonists, and pilocarpine to \\ninduce miosis. If these measures fail, a laser can be used to create a hole in the peripheral iris to relieve pupillary block. Many physicians are reluctant to dilate patients routinely for fundus examination because they fear precipitating an angle-closure glaucoma. The risk is actually remote and more than outweighed by the potential benefit to patients of discovering a hidden fundus lesion visible only through a fully dilated pupil. Moreover, a single attack of angle closure after phar -\\nmacologic dilatation rarely causes any permanent damage to the eye and serves as an inadvertent provocative test to identify patients with narrow angles who would benefit from prophylactic laser iridectomy.\\nEndophthalmitis  This results from bacterial, viral, fungal, or \\nparasitic infection of the internal structures of the eye. It usually is acquired by hematogenous seeding from a remote site. Chronically ill, diabetic, or immunosuppressed patients, especially those with a history of indwelling IV catheters or positive blood cultures, are at greatest risk for endogenous endophthalmitis. Although most patients have ocular pain and injection, visual loss is sometimes the only symp -')]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":39}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["question=\"\"\"A 38-year-old patient presents with a history of intermittent headaches,\n"," fatigue, joint pain, and cognitive difficulties.
